    "A share price is currently $\\$180$. At the end of one year, it will be either $\\$203$ or $\\$152$. The risk-free interest rate is $3\\%$ p.a. with continuous compounding. Consider an American put on this underlying. Find the exercise price for which holding the option for the year is equivalent to exercising immediately. This is the break-even exercise price. What effect would a decrease in the interest rate have on this break-even price?"
