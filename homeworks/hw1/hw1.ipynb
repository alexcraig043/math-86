    "A share currently trades at $\\$60$. A European call with exercise price $\\$58$ and expiry in three months trades at $\\$3$. The three month default-free discount rate is $5\\%$. A put is offered on the market, with exercise price $\\$58$ and expiry in three months, for $\\$1.50$. Do any arbitrage opportunities now exist? If there is a possible arbitrage, then construct a portfolio that will take advantage of it. (This is an application of put-call parity.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Under the **put-call parity**, if we long a share, long a put and short a call, we can simulate the performance of cash plus interest that has an expected value of the strike price. So $S(t) + P(t) -C(t) = PV_t(E)$, where $E$ is the strike price, $S$ is the stock, $P$ is the put, $C$ is the call, and $PV_t$ is the discounted value of the strike price at time $t$.\n",
